# Water_level-Pressure-sensor

# Introduction
This is a joint system that monitors and reports on the water level of a liquid tank, while also using a pressure pad as a trigger for various related actions varying on the different uses for the sensor as a whole. 

# Usage instruction:

The system allows for a sensor to be placed within a tank and will report on the level of liquid within the tank as well as issuing an alert of sorts once the tank's level is low/depleted. The pressure pad needs to be pushed down so the system knows that there is an action that needs to be performed e.g. a glass that needs to be filled with liquid.
